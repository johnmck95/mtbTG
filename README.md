# Project Overview

This repository contains the code for my [Mountain Bike Tuning Guide](https://mtbtg.netlify.app/),
a responsive website built with React, Typescript and ChakraUI that
is automatically deployed via Netlify. This project is being
actively developed, and is not a completed product at this stage.


### What is a Mountain Bike Tuning Guide?

The Tuning Guide is a tool for mountain bikers to optimize their weight
distribution, and therefore get the best experience on their bike.
The user completes a form that provides metrics to the Tuning Guide to
optimize the riders body position. Once it calculates their ideal bike
setup, it returns personalized instuctions on the adjustments that need 
to be made. 


### Why Build This?

There are two main reasons. Firstly, I want to start building a portfolio to
show future employers. Secondly, I'm an avid mountain biker and have seen there
is a genuine need for the product. Together, this is my perfect passion project.
My goal is to build a polished, tested, and responsive UI that genuinely helps mountain
bikers. If I can accomplish this, I will purchase a web domain and make the
Tuning Guide a free, public product with the goal of reaching more users.


# How To Use
