## Project Overview

This repositpory contains the code for https://mtbtg.netlify.app/,
a Mountain Bike Tuning Guide built with React, Typescript and ChakraUI.
The site is automatically deployed via Netlify. This projecet is being
actively developed, and is not a finsihed product.


### What is a Mountain Bike Tuning Guide?

The Tuning Guide takes a series of rider inputs, and calculates how to optimize
the riders body position. With this information, it makes suggestions for how
the rider should setup their specific bike to optimize their experience on the bike.


### Why build this?

There are two main reasons. Firtly, I wanted to start building a portfolio to
show future employers. Secondly, I'm an avid mountain biker and have seen there
is a genuine need for the product. Together, this is my perfect passion project.
My goal is to eventually purchase a domain and make the product available to 
help other mountian bikers.
