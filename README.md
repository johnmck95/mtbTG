# Project Overview

This repository is the codebase for the [Mountain Bike Tuning Guide](https://mtbtg.netlify.app/),
a responsive web app application designed for mobile, tablet and desktop devices alike. 
The application is hosted by Netlify and is built with React, Typescript and ChakraUI. This project is being actively developed in my spare time as I complete my Software Engineering
degree.

## What is the Mountain Bike Tuning Guide?

The Tuning Guide is a tool for riders of all abilities to optimize their weight
distribution and bike setup with the sole purpose of helping people have the best 
experience possible. The user fills in a short form, and once completed the algorithm 
calculates an ideal bike fit. The bike fit takes into consideration the person's size, 
ability level, handling preferences and personal equipment. Bike fits are 
complex by nature, and will always be subjective. My goal is to get 90% of riders 90% 
of the way to a perfect setup. If at any point the user would like to learn more, they 
can navigate to the _help_ page for detailed instructions.

## Why Build This?

There are two main reasons. Firstly, I want to start building a portfolio to develop
my technical skills in a way that I can present to future employers. Secondly, I'm an
avid mountain biker and have seen there is a genuine need for the product. Together, 
this is my perfect passion project. 
My goal is to build a maintainable, modern web application that abides by best practices,
and genuinely helps mountain bikers. If I can accomplish this, I will purchase a web 
domain and make the Tuning Guide a free, public product to reach more people.

# How To View the Mountain Bike Tuning Guide
## In Production

To share my progress before completing the Tuning Guide, I am
regularly deploying changes [here](https://mtbtg.netlify.app/).


## Locally 
You can clone the repository and run 
the application with `yarn start`, so long as you have _Node.js_ installed. Once
running, the app can be found at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
in your browser.
