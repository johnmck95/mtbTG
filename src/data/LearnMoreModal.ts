        title: "Handlebar Width",
        description: "Remove the grips and meausure between the widest points of the bar (with your preferred bar roll). Handlebar width will vary based on a persons height and wingspan. This adjustment assumes an average ape index. Handlebar width is strongly correlated to getting the tires onto side knobs while cornering, adjusting your effective reach, and general stability in a straight line."

        title: "Handlebar Rise",
        description: "Handlebar rise is determined by the manufacturer and cannot be adjusted. Changing the handlebar rise requires installing a differnt handlebar. Adjusting handlebar rise allows you to change the effective stack without altering the effective reach.",

        title: "Stem Length",
        description: "Stem length is determined by the manufacturer and cannot be adjusted. Changing the stem length requires installing a different stem. Stem length is strongly correlated to front wheel traction while descending, and steering flop while climbing.",

        title: "Stem Spacers",
        description: "This measurement referes to all components between the top of the headtube (headset, spacers), and the bottom of the stem. Increasing the amount of stem spacers increases your effective stack while reducing your effective reach. The magnitude of these adjustments is directly related to the headangle.",

        title: "Front Tire Pressure",
        description: "Tire pressure should be routinely checked, as your tires will naturally lose pressure. It is recommended to check air pressure before each ride for maximum performance. Please note, all recommendations assume an appropriate tire compound and inner rim width.",

        description: "Tire pressure should be routinely checked, as your tires will naturally lose pressure. It is recommended to check air pressure before each ride for maximum performance.  Please note, all recommendations assume an appropriate tire compound and inner rim width.",

        title: "Inserts",
        description: "Tire inserts can help increase traction by dampening the air chamber in the tire and allowing you to run lower pressures from the added rim protection. There are a plethora of tire inserts to choose from, some of which will not provide both benefits. CushCore is our recommendation, but please consult your local bike shop if in doubt.",
